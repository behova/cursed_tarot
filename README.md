experiment to try and learn Rust, Nom parsing library and Cursive library

the point of it is to turn BB forum code into images on the command line.

Right now I am using it to convert BB code in txt files to the cursive UI.

I made a 'Deck' of tarrot card .txt files, in BB code format, by converting images.

https://asciiart.club/(for image conversion)

the program creates a deck when started and will randomly draw one card.
